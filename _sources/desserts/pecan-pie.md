## Pie Crust
For a flaky pie crust, see this [recipe]().
> I should have rolled the dough a bit thinner and crimped the crust better. For next time, I'll remember to roll it at least 4 inches longer than the pie tin.

## Ingredients
1. 2 1/2 cups roughly chopped pecans.
1. 3 large eggs at room temparature.
1. 1/2 cup maple syrup.
1. 3/4 tsp salt
1. 3/4 cup brown sugar
1. 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
1. 1/4 cup or 1/2 stick unsalter butter.

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs together.
1. Add maple syrup, sea salt, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix thoroughly.
1. Melt the butter completely (but don't burn). Allow it to cool slightly.
1. Stream the melter butter in and whisk thoroughly.
    > It's important for the butter to be completely melted and to stream it in gradually, otherwise you'll end up with slightly solid butter that doesn't combine well with the rest of the mixture.
1. Place chopped pecans in the pie crust and pour in all the fillings.
1. Bake at 400 for 50-60 minutes.
