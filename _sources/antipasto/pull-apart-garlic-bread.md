## Ingredients

We don't have a scale (yet), so we converted the measurements.

### Bread
1. 2.4 cups (or 300g) bread flour
2. 1 tsp (or 4g) instant yeast
3. 1 tsp (or 6g) salt
4. 2.5 tsp (or 10g) sugar
5. 1/8 cup + 1/2 Tbsp (or 40g) soft butter
6. 1 cup (or 190g) cold milk

### Garlic butter
1. 1/2 cup (or 120g) melter butter
2. 1/4 garlic bulb (or 30g) minced garlic
3. 1/4 tsp (or 1g) salt
4. 1/2 bunch of cilantro

## Instructions
1. Combine milk, yeast, salt, and sugar in a bowl until the sugar crystals dissolve.
2. Add the flour and mix dought first with a fork until loosely combined. Then use your hand to combine all the dry flour and tip out on a table. 
    > At this stage, the dough should feed a bit wet (not very wet), and should feel easy to knead.
3. Knead for 3 minutes to develop gluten.
    > If the dough is very wet, add some flour. The dough should not be sticking to the table much at all.
4. Stretch the dough on the table and spread the butter. Tear, squish, and kneed for 3-5 minutes until all the butter is combined and no longer sticking to the table.
5. Cover and proof for 1 hour.
6. In the meanwhile, prepare the garlic butter by mixing melter butter, salt, garlic, and cilantro. This should be a runny consistency (we'll be dipping dough balls into these).
7. After proofing for 1 hour, fold the dough. Proof for another hour.
    > This is when you see most of the rise. The dough feels very soft to touch following this.
8. Cut the dough into balls of around 1 inch size.
9. Dip into garlic butter and place in a loaf tin.
    > Our loaf tin is 8 in x 4 in.
10. Cover and proof for another hour. 
11. Preheat over to 350F and place a cast iron pan.
    > The cast iron pan helps bake the bottom of the loaf.
12. Place the loaf pan on the cast iron pan and bake for 40 minutes.
13. Brush with remaining garlic butter and rest for 10 minutes. Serve.
