2. 1 can coconut milk (not cream, not light)
3. 1/4 cup low sodium tamari
4. 2 tablespoons honey
5. 1 tsp [harissa](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/mina-spicy-harissa-sauce-10-oz-b078fhcjg8) or [sambal oelek](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/sky-valley-sambal-oelek-paste-7-oz-b08qt8kzlj)
6. 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
7. 1/4 cup [Thai red curry paste](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/curry-love-red-thai-curry-paste-423-oz-b08qth8np4)
8. 8 oz box of cremini mushrooms
9. 2 red or yellow bell peppers (not green)
9. 6 oz broccoli florets
10. 4 oz tofu
10. 1 inch (x 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch) ginger
11. 2 large cloves garlic
12. 2 squares of [millet and brown rice ramen](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/lotus-foods-organic-millet-brown-rice-ramen-4pack-b00xmziqr4)
13. Juice of 1 lemon
14. Chopped peanuts and toasted sesame oil, for serving

## Instructions
1. Bake tofu for 10-15 minutes at 350F.
1. Crush ginger and garlic to a paste (or mince).
1. Combine vegetable broth, coconut milk, tamari, honey, harissa (or sambal oelek), peanut butter, red curry paste, and ginger-garlic paste in a large pot over medium heat.
1. Add mushrooms, bell peppers and broccoli and simmer for 10 minutes.
    > I didn't change the heat.
1. Add salt to taste.
    > I only needed to add around a tsp as the peanut butter, curry paste, and harissa had some salt.
1. Turn off the heat, squeeze juice from one lemon.
1. Cook ramen according to instructions in a separate pot.
    > I highly recommend not cooking the ramen in the broth. The starchiness makes the broth extremely thick.
1. Add ramen to bowls, and ladle the broth in. Top with tofu, peanutes, and sesame oil.
